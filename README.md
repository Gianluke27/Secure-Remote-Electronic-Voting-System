# Secure Remote Electronic Voting System
This repository hosts a project aimed at addressing the challenges and complexities of implementing a secure remote electronic voting system. With the increasing need for flexible and accessible voting methods, especially during pandemics and for geographically mobile populations, the project explores the design and implementation of a voting system that prioritizes efficiency, confidentiality, integrity, and transparency.

The project focuses on four key pillars:

Confidentiality: Ensuring sensitive data remains confidential even in the face of potential attacks.
Integrity: Guaranteeing the system functions as intended even under attack scenarios.
Transparency: Designing the system without reliance on secretive algorithms and ensuring resilience to abuse by allowing all stakeholders to verify its integrity.
Efficiency: Creating a system that is usable with minimal cost and delay.
Through a structured approach, the project is divided into four work packages:

Model Definition (WP1): Identifying honest actors and adversaries within the system, defining functionality, and outlining desired properties.
Solution Design (WP2): Developing a remote electronic voting system that balances efficiency, transparency, confidentiality, and security.
Analysis (WP3): Evaluating the proposed solution against the defined model, including the generation and justification of a detailed radar chart comparing efficiency, confidentiality, integrity, and transparency.
Implementation and Performance (WP4): Implementing a simulated version of the voting system and assessing its performance.
The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive exploration of remote electronic voting, leveraging existing knowledge and tools while critically examining potential trade-offs and security implications.
